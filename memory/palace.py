"""Memory Palace: Day-1 buckets + always-on gold short_memory seed.

On a fresh clone / new machine:
  - ``ensure_memory_palace()`` creates core identity buckets if missing
  - ``ensure_short_memory()`` ALWAYS guarantees ``short_memory.md`` exists
    with ``gold: true`` so startup auto-load and the 10-turn nudge work
    with zero friction.
