# Changelog

All notable changes to Dulus will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.10.9] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- MemPalace auto-mine reliability on Windows and session exit: centralized
  `memory/mempalace_bridge.py` so MemorySave, consolidate, and `/exit`
  all schedule the real `mempalace mine` (package), not only local AI file mining.
- Windows child process was dying silently (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW` alone kept the
  mine in the parent console job). Detach with `DETACHED_PROCESS` +
  `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`; log to `$DULUS_HOME/logs/mempalace_mine.log`.
- Wait briefly for in-flight mines before `os._exit` so indexes are not dropped.
- User memory paths respect `DULUS_HOME` instead of hard-coding `~/.dulus`.

### Added
- Multi-language README documentation (EN, ES, FR, ZH, JA, KO, PT, RU, AR)
- Comprehensive architecture documentation
- API reference documentation
- Deployment guide
- Security policy
- Brand guidelines

## [3.9.5] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- TTS `c` cancel key not working while the REPL prompt was active:
  `msvcrt.kbhit()` only sees keystrokes when the raw console owns stdin, so
  prompt_toolkit swallowed the `c` before the watcher saw it. Added a second
  detection path via `GetAsyncKeyState` (physical key state, edge-detected)
  that fires regardless of who owns stdin, plus a 30ms sleep so the watcher
  no longer busy-spins a CPU core during playback.

## [3.9.4] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Catastrophic config reset: `save_config()` wrote the caller's dict verbatim,
  so a thin dict (e.g. only `lang` + `user_name` at early startup) silently
  wiped every other key — API keys, voice config, everything. Now it merges
  DEFAULTS + on-disk config first (with `.bak` fallback if the on-disk copy
  is corrupt), then applies runtime changes on top.

## [3.9.3] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- `/lang` was silently overpowered by `soul.md` / gold memories that assert a
  voice ("I speak Dominican Spanish"). The chosen language is now re-asserted
  at the end of the system prompt (highest-authority position) and `/lang`
  injects an immediate directive into the live conversation so the switch
  takes effect the same turn. Defaults untouched — no `/lang` set means the
  soul keeps control.

## [3.9.2] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `/update` self-update command: quiet cached (6h TTL) non-blocking PyPI check
  on startup, in-place upgrade, `now|check|status|on|off` subcommands.

## [3.9.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- MCP Marketplace: `/mcp list|search|install` over a live catalog of 2000+
  servers from registry.modelcontextprotocol.io + awesome-mcp, deduped,
  6h-TTL cached, offline-safe. One-shot install: resolve command, write
  config, connect, verify tools, hot-reload into the live session.

### Fixed
- Windows launcher for node-based MCP servers (`npx` ships as `npx.cmd`).

## [3.6.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Opt-in telemetry never sent events: `MP_TOKEN` defaulted to empty string so
  `is_enabled()` was always False, even after user consent. The public
  project's write-only ingestion token now ships as the default
  (`DULUS_MP_TOKEN` env var still overrides).

### Added
- Named telemetry events (names/counts only — never content): `message_sent`,
  `tool_used`, `command_used`, `model_selected`, wired into the REPL loop,
  tool dispatch, slash commands and `/model`.
- Memory: session history search improvements — token matching, newest-first
  ordering, no truncation (from 786bd34).
